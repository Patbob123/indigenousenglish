        <center>How Indigenous Literature Restores Balance in our Disconnected World</center>
    <p>What if I told you that there is a solution to global issues such as climate change, racism, and war? Only those who are ignorant of Indigenous literature will try to dismiss this idea, labelling it as foolish. I used to be one of these people, blind to a significant key to these solutions: balance. In order to find balance as Canadians, we must turn to Indigenous literature since it plays a big role in Canadian society. Indigenous literature teaches important ideologies regarding balance and promotes representation of the FNMI community, which allows for new perspectives to balance out the old, stubborn ones. After learning from Indigenous literature, all Canadians and perhaps all humans will achieve a state of harmony and stability.
    </p></br>

    <p>If a population of predators wipes out their prey, the population is doomed. Indigenous people realized this interconnection between all living and non-living things long ago, incorporating it into their ideology and beliefs. These beliefs accumulate and are passed down through generations with the use of oral storytelling and, eventually, literature. The Mi’kmaq, one of the Indigenous tribes in Canada, believe that everything around us is connected and equal. According to their teachings,
    </p>

    <p id = 'txt'>[The Mi’kmaq] look above and within and below, and to all the four directions . . . And so in the centre [they] are communicating with the whole cycle of life in all its aspects, in respect for how life begins, and is all tied together. (Augustine)
    </p>

    <p>The Mi’kmaq view all parts of life as connected and equally important. Since all aspects of their life are interconnected, one cannot exist without another. They realize that for every life created, the lives of many animals are ended in return. Therefore, the Mi’kmaq only take resources that are necessary for their survival. In stark contrast, modernized countries view the world as a battleground for resources. This materialistic mindset leads many to live a life in constant pursuit of wealth and power. There are consequences to putting a sole focus on economic growth while dismissing the other facets of improvement. One such example is the exploitation of natural resources, which causes an imbalance in nature. When our natural environment loses vital components such as plants and animals faster than it can recover, it leads to climate change and a decline in biodiversity. In order to save ourselves from environmental collapse, we must learn to adopt these ideologies into our culture through Indigenous literature. Thus, the world will automatically become more stable once we stop pushing it into a state of disarray.
    </p></br>

    <p>There are over 60 different Indigenous tribes in Canada, each with its own diverse traditions and perspectives. However, many Canadians are unaware of these cultures because of their minimal presence in mainstream society. The majority of the population in Canada is of Caucasian descent, dwarfing the Indigenous population. With such a large population disparity, the less dominant culture will inevitably have little to no voice. Jennifer Podemski, an Anishinaabe writer and actress, notices this lack of Indigenous representation. She mentions how, "[t]o [her], representation of First Nations people in television and film is so important because very few people know anything about [them]. . . . In school, there was no representation of First Nations people in the textbooks, either. This also made [her] feel invisible" (Podemski 1). Indigenous literature opens up FNMI ideas to be accessed by everyone, which makes the Indigenous presence known. Representing Indigenous people in a truthful manner allows for inclusivity. Indigenous literature not only informs us of facts but also conveys the author's emotions. By understanding the Indigenous perspective, we start to question and challenge negative stereotypes. Over time, these efforts will balance the playing field for Indigenous people, which makes it easier to minimize social issues such as racism. Lastly, Indigenous literature is only possible because of the existence of Indigenous people. If they decide that trying to communicate with the rest of Canada is a worthless effort, it will be increasingly difficult to find Indigenous literature, which continues the cycle of ignorance. Therefore, reading Indigenous literature encourages its production and allows us to further harmonize with FNMI in Canada. 
    </p></br>

    <p>To further understand the importance of Indigenous literature, we must examine a place without it. The example I am most familiar with is China, a country whose government is commonly known for its materialistic approaches to growth and oppressive nature. In the summer of 2018, I went back to China after two years, and I was suffocating; I literally could not breathe. After two years of living in Canada and breathing Canadian air, I could hardly stand polluted Chinese air. It was miserable to step out of the range of the air conditioner due to the unnaturally high temperatures and humid air. The main reason for this is the little label on the back of your stuff that reads "Made in China". As the world’s leading manufacturer, China establishes trade relations with many countries for temporary profit. To keep up with the supply, the government builds factories at the expense of its natural environment. On the other hand, the Mi’kmaq view nature as a connected piece of the world and treat it with the utmost respect. This is one of the reasons why the climate in Canada is much less toxic compared to China. With respect to minority representation, China is also lacking. In 2014, an ethnic minority in China by the name of the Uighur organized a terrorist attack against civilians in Urumqi, Xinjiang, killing 31 people. According to BBC News, the reason was "[t]he Chinese government's effort to mount a "people's war" against terror has made little headway in a climate where many Uighurs feel they are victims of discrimination, religious repression and economic marginalisation." (BBC News). Many people outside and inside China are unaware because the voices of these minority groups are suppressed. When this happens, the government is free to do whatever it pleases in the public's eye and further raises the tension between these ethnic groups. This is a parallel to how Jennifer Podemski felt invisible and decided to fight back using Indigenous literature. In the case of some Uighurs, they chose to fight back with violence. Comparing these two options side by side, I would much rather choose the first option. China is imbalanced in terms of environment and representation because they do not care about the literature that can guide them in a better direction. However, Canada still has people who have looked after this land for thousands of years, and their stories are all captured in Indigenous literature. As Canadians, we must take the first step and maintain the earth we live on.
    </p></br>

    <p>By representing Indigenous perspectives and providing unique ideologies, Indigenous literature becomes a tool to maintain balance. It is more intuitive to understand balance through Indigenous literature compared to other literature because balance is tightly linked with FNMI values. Once an equilibrium is reached between everything in the world, it will all become connected, and conflict will disappear. If a balance is struck between us and nature, environmental issues will slowly resolve themselves. On the other hand, if a balance is achieved between the representation of different social groups, it will greatly reduce fighting and allow us to live together. Admittedly, Indigenous literature is merely the starting point for attaining balance since it only contains a fraction of the perspectives in the world. With so many more perspectives and knowledge sources to consult, we must ask ourselves, "Why should we just stop at Indigenous literature?"

    "reflect2.txt":`<center>How Equality and Understanding Builds a Strong Community</center>
    <p>This short stop-motion animation is about three bears who demonstrate how to be good community members by having mutual respect and understanding. The medium of stop motion parallels a good community. On its own, each image serves its purpose as a pleasant picture. However, when they are connected, the group of images creates a new meaning far beyond what an individual can achieve. The use of satire allows a story to subtly point out and ridicule existing political issues or social vices. In the story of Coyote Columbus, after Christopher Columbus arrived in North America, this newcomer immediately drew the conclusion that the local Indians were inferior. In fact, "Christopher Columbus sold the Indians . . .  and [he] became rich and famous" (King 22). The reader is forced to critically think about the characters and actions of the Europeans. Despite their different cultures and appearances, the bears in my story welcomed each other through a mutual exchange of gifts and friendly gestures, such as dancing. This establishes the common goal of building a cooperative community. Although not the focus of the parody, The Little Red Riding Hood by James Finn Garner illustrates how relationships can be healed. After the wolf’s attempt at devouring Red Riding Hood and her grandma, they were still able to find "a certain commonality of purpose . . . [and] set up an alternative household based on mutual respect and co-operation" (Garner 9). Grizz and Ice Bear initially misunderstood Panda due to his foreign origin. However, both sides quickly came to understand their differences and learn to live together. The bear is an Indigenous symbol of strength and healing, which is represented by bears. All community members have a responsibility to mend and strengthen their relationships. In the end, by being fair and evaluating each other's circumstances, the bears were able to build a strong foundation for their community.

    "reflect3.txt":`<center>How do we learn to live together? (Notes)</center>

    <center>Topic 1 - Bear Taylor</center>
    <p>Quote:</p>
    <p>“But the sides aren’t entirely drawn on racial lines, my play is called ‘Cottagers AND Indians’ NOT ‘Cottagers V.S. Indians’. On my reserve, at least one local businessman has sympathy for the Cottager position”. 
    </p></br>

    <p>This was a statement by Drew Hayden Taylor referring to some Indigenous people, such as Bear Taylor, who are not fighting a constant battle with other members of the community. This is evidence that your origins do not determine your capability of fitting into a multicultural society.
    </p></br>

    <center>Topic 2 - Men vs Women Jubliee Video</center>
    
    <p>In the Jubilee video, the activists were having a healthy discussion about men’s rights and feminism. Essentially, they were figuring out how men and women can live together. They needed to understand the other side, and what their needs and wants are, so everyone can accommodate them. 
    </p></br>

    <center>Topic 3 - Workforce</center>
    
    <p>Work is a part of life. Learning how to work together allows us to live together. This connects to me through my co-op experience and I learned to be flexible for and with my co-workers. If everyone did not understand our needs
    </p></br>

    <center>Topic 4 - Laws</center>
    
    <p>Laws are guidelines for us to live together. In a democratic country like Canada, laws are decided based on days or weeks or longer worth of discussion coming from different political perspectives. Riparian rights are a great example due to the fact that their existence helps us divide up land ownership. The lack of a law to divide the lake is the exact problem that the characters in Cottagers and Indians are facing. Therefore, if well-thought-out laws are created, it acts as a railing to guide us so that we can live together.
    </p></br>

    <center>Topic 5 - The title Cottagers AND Indians</center>
    
    <p>D. Taylor mentions how the versus is not in the title, instead, it is Cottagers and Indians. This implies that the play is about two groups trying to reach common ground and not one about fighting. This can is apparent in the play as Maureen and Arthur converse to understand each other’s current situations and perspectives. In the real events that Cottagers and Indians is based on, Larry is the one who is trying to resolve this conflict when he tries to share the land with James Whetung. However, James feels the need to be impactful about the message he is trying to spread. This does not discredit James’ willingness to live together with the cottagers. It is just that he feels the cottagers are not meeting his need for manoomin.
    </p></br>

    <center>Topic 6 - Sympathy</center>
    <p>Quote:</p>
    <p>“On my reserve, at least one local business man has sympathy for the Cottager position”. 
    </p>
    
    <p>Again, this refers to Bear Taylor, who learned to live together with the Cottagers. As the owner of a boating business, he is probably used to doing business with people who are not Indigenous. Bear can sympathize with the cottagers because he sees their point of view, which is that the lake should be clear and safe for people. If James can understand the cottagers’ point of view, then this conflict would have never arisen in the first place. Therefore, sympathizing with others and seeing their perspective allows us to live together. 
    </p></br>

    <center>Topic 7 - Jordin Tootoo</center>
    
    <p>In his autobiography, Jordin talks about how everyone in the land looks out for each other. This is because, in the land, a wrong move or lack of cooperation can spell life or death. This is how the community in Rankin Inlet survives together. They learn how to put aside personal feelings and help each other when in need. In this sense, the people of Rankin Inlet learn to literally live together without dying.

    <center>To Learn. To Experience. To Observe. To be Human</center>
    <p>Biologically, homo sapiens are genetically unique from every other species on the planet. However, the classification of homo sapiens is already given at birth. We are not trying to learn to be homo sapiens, we are learning to be human. To further understand personhood, we must treat the word "human" as an adjective as opposed to a noun. There are no specific criteria to determine one's humanity but a set of guidelines to steer one in the right direction. These guidelines can range from showing complex emotions such as sympathy, to understanding and forming cultures. There are two main ways to discover the guidelines for being human: from listening and from the media.
    </p></br>

    <p>When I go through life, I learn life lessons that contain important values and ideologies. However, there is only so much I can do, which is why I acquire experience from others around me. For example, in the creation story of the Mi’kmaq, Glooscap learns his ways of valuing from the Mother of the North. The mother "came to teach [Glooscap] how to love and understand and share with others, about how we all rely on one another for survival" (Augustine). Using the character, the Mother of the North, the Mi’kmaq teach their young how to be grateful and sympathetic towards others. The immense capacity to feel love and gratitude toward others is a distinctly human trait. This reminded me of my grandmother, who was a university professor and deeply cared for all her students. There were times she took money out of her own pocket to financially aid her students. Some may ridicule her foolishness, but my grandmother would always do what she believed was right. She told me that giving to others is what makes us human. In short, I learned to be human when I gather values and ideologies by interacting with the world as well as listening to those I encountered along the way.
    </p></br>

    <p>In an age where information can be spread in the blink of an eye, the media is a great tool to help us learn to be human. This year, Pope Francis "humbly beg[ged] forgiveness for the evil committed by so many Christians" (Francis), which has spread over the media and reached the hearts of millions. "I have come to your native lands to tell you in person of my sorrow, to implore God's forgiveness, healing, and reconciliation," (Francis) stated the Pope. The Pope showed regret and guilt for the past actions of his people. To many, Pope Francis can be seen as a role model to learn from; to learn how to be remorseful and, ultimately, human. The conflict between Indigenous peoples and Christians can be compared to another event in history, the Holocaust. During World War II, the Jewish people were dehumanized. They became nothing more than diseases to be eradicated. This lack of sympathy is why, to this day, Adolf Hitler is viewed as anything but human. The media, especially the internet, has become essential for revisiting history. It helps us view and learn from past mistakes that made us less human.
    </p></br>

    <p>To preserve the essence of what makes us human, we need to be attentive to those with more experience and use powerful educational tools such as the media. By knowing these traits, we understand ourselves and other humans. The history of the human race has all come together to fulfil the ultimate goal—to become human.
